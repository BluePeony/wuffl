# Wuffl
<strong> 1. Introduction </strong>  
Wuffl is a simple image viewer which can move pictures either to a „Selected“ folder or to a „Deleted“ folder. "Selected" and "Deleted" folders are located in the same folder as the chosen picture. Wuffl is available for Linux Ubuntu >=14.04, Mac >= OS Ventura and Windows >=10.  

Imagine you review you vacation photographs and you need to select which pictures to show to your friends at the next party, or you work your way through a bunch of old pictures and you need to select a view of them for a anniversary celebration. Wuffl allows you to move the picture to an extra folder ("Selected") or to a "Deleted" folder while viewing it.
